## Overview

Check out the slides for [Hacking WebAssembly Games with Binary Instrumentation](https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2027/DEF%20CON%2027%20presentations/DEFCON-27-Jack-Baker-Hacking-Web-Assembly-Games.pdf) at Defcon 27.

Cetus is a browser extension (Tested on Chrome and Firefox) for hacking WebAssembly games. Cetus implements a number of features familiar to [Cheat Engine](https://www.cheatengine.org) users

- Memory searching
- Watchpoints (Implemented via binary instrumentation using [WAIL](https://github.com/Qwokka/wail))
- Memory freezing
- Code disassembly
- Code patching

The name Cetus comes from the Latin word for "sea monster"
